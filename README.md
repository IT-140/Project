# The Lich King's Terror
Welcome to "The Lich King's Terror" a text-based adventure game where you explore a crypt, gather mystical items, and confront the dreaded Lich King. This game was developed as part of a course project to demonstrate the application of Python programming concepts, including control structures, functions, and data management.

# About the Project
In this project, the main objective was to develop a fully functional text-based game where the player navigates through different rooms, collects items, and ultimately faces a final challenge. The game was designed to reinforce concepts such as:
- Data Structures: Using dictionaries to manage rooms, items, and navigation.
- Functions: Modularizing the code into reusable functions to handle player actions and game logic.
- Control Flow: Implementing decision-making and loops to create an interactive gameplay experience.
- User Input Handling: Ensuring the game can process and respond to player commands effectively.
- Game Design: Crafting a storyline and game mechanics that engage the player.

# Key Features
- Room Navigation: Move through different rooms in the crypt using directional commands.
- Item Collection: Discover and collect six powerful items that are essential to defeating the Lich King.
- Inventory Management: Track the items you've collected and use them strategically to win the game.
- Dynamic Gameplay: Experience different outcomes based on the items you collect and the paths you choose.

# How to Play
1. Movement: Use commands like 'go North', 'go South', 'go East', and 'go West' to navigate through rooms.
2. Collect Items: Use the get [item name] command to collect items when they are available in a room.
3. Check Status: Use the status command to view your current room, items in the room, and your inventory.
4. Quit the Game: Use the quit command to exit the game at any time.

# Winning the Game
To win the game, you must collect all six items scattered throughout the crypt and then face the Lich King in the Ritual Sanctum. If you encounter the Lich King without all the items, you will lose and become part of his undead army.

# Reflection
Developing "The Lich King's Terror" was a great learning experience in structuring a Python program, managing data, and implementing user interactions. The process of breaking down the game mechanics into modular functions and ensuring smooth user experience was particularly valuable. This project also highlighted the importance of clear code documentation and error handling, which are essential for creating maintainable software.

# Future Enhancements
While the game is fully functional, there are several enhancements that could be considered for future iterations:

- Expanded Storyline: Adding more rooms, items, and challenges to create a more complex adventure.
- Enhanced User Interface: Implementing a graphical interface to provide a more immersive experience.
- Save and Load Feature: Allowing players to save their progress and resume the game later.

# How to Run the Game
To play the game, simply run the 'TextBasedGame.py' file in a Python environment. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If you're running the game in a terminal, the game will prompt you for commands and guide you through the adventure.
